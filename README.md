> A simple PRNG (Pseudo Random Number Generator)


This is a simple PRNG algorithm, created by myself as an exercise.
It can generate numbers up to 32 bits, but can be adapted to bigger numbers.
More details about the implementation and functioning of this algorithm will be disclosed soon, when I write a documentation for it.
